# Status Update - 9/27/2024

## Project Name

**Cilium**

## This Week

This week, I researched Cilium, Kubernetes, and Terraform to understand how these tools work together. My main focus was on Kubernetes, as it forms the core of what we will be doing, with Terraform and Cilium supporting it. I completed an interactive lab on Cilium by Isovalent, which helped me understand the concept of clusters and how to enforce policies between pods.

## Next Week

Next week, I plan to continue deepening my understanding of Kubernetes, Terraform, and Cilium by exploring more advanced features and use cases. I aim to identify a project where I can apply these tools practically and start experimenting with them in a real-world context. This will help me solidify my knowledge and gain hands-on experience.
