# Status Update - 10/04/2024

## Project Name

**Cilium**

## This Week

This week, I spent time learning about Kubernetes and its role in container orchestration. I also experimented with Terraform by creating and managing infrastructure as code. These hands-on experiences helped me better understand how to deploy and manage applications in cloud environments.

## Next Week

Next week, I plan to continue learning about Cilium and delve into its specific components, such as networking policies and security features. I will also explore more DevOps practices to enhance my understanding of automating cloud infrastructure. Additionally, I intend to identify a Cilium-related project that I can work on for the remainder of the semester.
