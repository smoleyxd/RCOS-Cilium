## Project Name

**Cilium**

## This Week

This week, I installed all the necessary software and tools to begin contributing to the project, which focuses on analyzing and testing the networking aspect of Cilium. I took time to watch introductory videos on Minikube, Terraform, and Cilium to understand their use cases and how they work together in a cloud-native environment. This helped me familiarize myself with the setup process and some key concepts behind these tools. Additionally, I started reading the Cilium documentation, specifically focusing on its networking capabilities to better understand its functionality.

## Next Week

Next week, I plan to continue exploring Ciliumâ€™s documentation, focusing primarily on its networking aspects while also looking into other areas like security and observability for a broader understanding. My main focus will be on experimenting with and testing Cilium's networking features in more detail. I will set up a Minikube environment to conduct these tests and get hands-on experience. Additionally, I plan to start experimenting with writing Terraform configurations to automate the setup of Kubernetes clusters for testing purposes. While I'll try out other features, my primary effort will be centered on networking.
