Over this week, I researched Cilium's purpose and it's wide use, including it's ability to extend Kubernetes usage by providing security, visibility and networking. Through Isovalent's lab, I learned how Cilium operates in a Kubernetes cluster and how it controls HTTP requests so that certain pods have certain HTTP actions that can be performed based on Cilium rules. During the semester, I would like to incorporate Cilium and Kubernetes to deploy a project as well as possibly resolving github issues. I've been wanting to learn cloud deployment as it is a big component to the DevOps process. Attatched is an image of the completed lab.
